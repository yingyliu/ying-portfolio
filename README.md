## Description
This website is about me and my past working experience. For the layout, I tried my best to resemble as the layout from the .gif of the homework.

## Tech used
- HTML
- CSS
- GitHub
- Terminal
- Visual Studio Code

## Motivation
I want to use this portfolio to show the reader with my name, photo, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me.

## Contribute
I design the layout and content of the website and make sure everything works functionally as mentioned in the acceptance criteria.

## Build Status
Originally in the first version, I was not experienced in changing the layout as describe in the .gif from the homework example, however, after spending sometimes to try-and-error on the "inspector", I finally work it out.
